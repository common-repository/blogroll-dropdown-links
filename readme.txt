Place your blogroll as a dropdown list in a widget area

== Description ==

Blogroll Dropdown is a widget that places your blogroll links as a dropdown box helping you to save space in your widget area. Since the Link Manager is by default disabled in newer versions of WordPress, Blogroll Dropdown will activate it again to let you manage your links.

The plugin lets you select which links category you'd like publish as a dropbox. Alternatively you can publish all your links regardless of categories.

Blogroll Dropdown is a modification of the seemingly abandoned H. T. Si's Dropdown Links Widget, making it possible to eliminate the Widget title and have the default option to link to a custom URL instead of being blank and confusing your visitors.
